# react-learning-exercise
This is a simple app I built to teach myself the basics of the react framework by following the tutorial in [survivejs](https://survivejs.com/) through chapter 5. It lets you build a list of items. Items in the list can be added by clicking the '+' button. Clicking a list item makes it possible to edit it's text, and pressing the 'X' button next to each item deletes it. List items are persisted in localstorage. 



To start the app, use 
```shell 
npm start
```
To run the tests, use
```shell
npm test
```
